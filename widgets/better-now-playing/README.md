# Better Now Playing - Pock Widget

A fixed fork of the [now-playing-widget](https://github.com/pock/now-playing-widget) Pock widget, updated to work on **macOS 15.4 and later**, where Apple privatized direct access to the MediaRemote framework.

## Rationale

In macOS 15.4, Apple quietly restricted the private MediaRemote framework so third-party apps could no longer use it to read what's playing. This broke the original widget (and many other apps) entirely. This fork uses a clever workaround via a system Perl script that still has access, so everything works again.

## Features

- **Works with all media players** - Apple Music, Spotify, YouTube, etc.
- **Revamped album art** - now fully working with reworked animation (smoother), glow animation, rounded corners and adjustable sizes
- **Automatically removes the built-in macOS Now Playing Touch Bar icon** - (looks like bar graph in circle) It would otherwise appear alongside the widget and be quite redundant and annoying
- **Uses mediaremote-adapter** - the only workaround for Apple's API privatization in macOS 15.4+

## Installation via `.pock` file (Recommended)

1. **Download the latest `.pock` file** from [Releases](https://github.com/JosephPri/Better-Now-Playing-Pock-Widget/releases)
2. **Install in Pock** - Double-click/open the `.pock` file, Pock installs it automatically
   > If MacOS prevents you from opening the file for security reasons, navigate to **System Settings** > **Privacy and Security** and scroll until you see `"Better Now Playing.pock" was blocked to protect your Mac` and click **Open Anyway**
3. **Configure the widget** - click the Pock icon in the menu bar, then select **Manage Widgets** (`⌘M`). Here you can choose your preferred widget layout and other settings.
4. **Add to Touch Bar** - click the Pock icon again and select **Customize Pock...** (`⌘P`), then drag the **Better Now Playing** widget down to the Touch Bar. 
   > If nothing happens after clicking **Customize Pock...**, repeat step 4 with the Widget Manager (from step 3) still open.
